# Hello~,world~!

I'm Mo/Mohammed/Naz (it's a long story!). I'm a recent grad in MSc Mathematics of Cybersecurity from a Top 4 UK Research University. 

Above all else, passionate about Data Science and Machine Learning and working on breaking into the data world!

- 🌟 are personal projects, others were part of my MSc


#### Future Dream Projects:
 - Analysing the dying down of mid-budget movies ($15-75mn) and overall Hollywood movie analytics and trends 1980-2020
 - Generative models (GANs) as feature extractors to de-bias model inference (idea from Ian Goodfellow's talk w/ Lex Fridman)

<!-- -  Hi, I’m @mosefaq. I'm listed in my group contributions as Mo/Mohammed/Naz.
-  I’m interested in exploring limitations of Machine Learning models, particularly in regards to model generalisability and ethics.
-  I am currently working on:
    - becoming better at telling compelling (truthful) stories with data
    - exploring the use of GANs as feature extractors to build models free of bias
- I have previously worked on:
  - supervise and unsupervised learning models, with a focus on classification and intrusion detection
  - processeses for creating effective train/cross-val/test sets in skewed or imbalanced datasets
  - exploring model generalisability
  - topic modelling, sentiment analysis 
  - synthetic email generations for insider threat 
<!--  I’m currently learning more about GANs and their potential use as feature extractors to build models free of bias e.g. gender/ethnicity.
